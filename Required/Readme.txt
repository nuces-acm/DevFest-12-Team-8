				Team # 8


The full description of problem identified and solution propsed can be find in Summary.pdf.
The main thing to highlight here is that our major focus has been 'Architecture of the Solution'. Therefore we have been less focused on front-UI development. We've built a strong Back-end (exposed webservices and maintained database) and left room for future integrations and improvement.
You'll find the solution quite flexible and highly scalable from developer's perspective.ch
We've given just a few ASPX web pages just for an example. The website should not be considered as our deliverable rather our deliverable is, as said earlier, 'Architecture of Solution'.
